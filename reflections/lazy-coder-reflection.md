# ðŸ§  Am I a Lazy Coder?

It often feels like I take the _easiest_ way when I code. 
I don't plan much in advance, I just go ahead and explore until I eventually _bump into_ something that works. 

I sometimes think I could save time and write cleaner, better-designed code if I stopped to plan, broke the problem into smaller pieces, and followed a clear strategy.
But my mind resists that. It feels like too much trouble. 
I like to _see things working_, so I'd rather build messy code that doesn't work yet and debug my way through it.

Apparently, this is called **tinkering**. 
If it has a name, maybe it's legitimate.
That is a relief, to be honest.

Still, I wonder if this approach won't get me into trouble down the line.

I suppose I can always **let myself explore messily**, but then revisit and clean the code after it works, focusing on readability, structure, and maintainability.

One thing that struck me:
People often describe me as organised and disciplined.
But when I code, something else shows up â€” a kind of chaos, improvisation, stubbornness?
I wonder if coding reveals a part of myself I donâ€™t usually give much space to.
