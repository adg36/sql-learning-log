# 🕵️‍♀️ Fiftyville Investigation – CS50x SQL Project

This is a project from [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x), Harvard’s introductory course to Computer Science. The challenge: solve a fictional crime using nothing but logic, structured data, and SQL.

---

## 🎯 The Premise

The town of Fiftyville has suffered a curious theft — and as the newly appointed (data-driven) investigator, you’re handed a full SQLite database with:

- Crime scene reports
- Interview transcripts
- Phone logs
- ATM transactions
- Airport records
- Vehicle activity

The case: reconstruct what happened, identify the thief, trace their escape, and discover their accomplice.

## 🧠 My Approach (no spoilers)

I broke the problem down into a structured pipeline of deduction:

### 1. Timeline Reconstruction  
I filtered crime reports and eyewitness interviews to pinpoint the exact time and place of the theft.

### 2. Suspect Narrowing  
Using subqueries and joins, I connected clues from ATM withdrawals, license plates, and witness statements to build a list of suspects.

### 3. Pattern Cross-Referencing  
I cross-checked suspect behaviour — car movement, phone calls, flight records — across multiple tables to eliminate false positives.

### 4. Final Identification  
I combined filtered datasets to confirm not just the perpetrator, but also their getaway flight and accomplice — based solely on data logic.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- SQLite (via DB Browser)
- Visual Studio Code
- Standard SQL (no procedural code)

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to **translate a real-world question into queryable hypotheses**
- How to **layer joins, filters and logic** to converge on an answer
- The value of naming patterns, building incrementally, and documenting each inference
- Most importantly: that I really enjoy this kind of reasoning-heavy, structured investigation

## 🚫 Note on Solutions

To preserve the academic integrity of the course, this repo does **not** include the actual SQL queries or final answer. The focus is on method and reasoning.

## 🧭 What’s Next?

This project confirmed that I’m drawn to roles involving:

- Data integrity & quality
- Structured investigation
- Systems thinking & logic
- Clear communication of complex deductions

I’m currently deepening my skills in SQL, Python and data workflows — and actively exploring roles in QA, data storytelling and analytical problem-solving.
